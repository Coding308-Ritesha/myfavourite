        <p>Just as any 11 year old, I have a range of different hobbies. From reading books to singing and dancing, I daresay, it was quite difficult to choose. But after attending over 50 coding classes and completing more than 50 projects, who can resist choosing 'Coding.' Of course, I didn't just choose this topic because of my tedious hard work, but also of its loadful amount of benefits. By learning how to code, we can develop our problem solving skills as well as our presentation skills. It also helps magnificently, to boost our confidence. But obviously, the most important benefit of coding is CREATIVITY. Sometimes, this can be hiding below the surface, but coding will definitely help it rise. </p>
